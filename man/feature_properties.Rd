\title{Calculation of properties of features}
\usage{
feature_properties(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Object of class \code{Specfeat}}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{Specfeat} containing the properties as
(part of the) attribute table.
}
\description{
Function to calculate feature properties such as the area, the position of
the maximum and several other parameters.
}
\details{
The function calculates several parameters: \itemize{ \item\emph{area}: The
feature area is calculated by
\deqn{area_{F_{i}}=\sum^{max(\lambda)}_{k=min(\lambda)} BD\lambda,} with
\eqn{area_{F_{i}}} is the area of the feature i, \eqn{min(\lambda)} is the
minimum wavelength of the spectrum, \eqn{max(\lambda)} is the maximum
wavelength of the spectrum and \eqn{BD} is the band depth.

\item\emph{max}: Wavelength position of the maximum value observed in the
feature.  \item Parameters based on half-max values: \itemize{ \item\emph{lo}
and \emph{up}: Wavelength position of the \emph{lo}wer and \emph{up}per
half-max value.  \item\emph{width}: Difference between wavelength positions
of \emph{up}per and \emph{lo}wer half-max values.  \item\emph{gauss_lo}:
Similarity of the Gauss distribution function and the feature values between
the \emph{lo}wer half-max and the \emph{max}imum position. As similarity
measurement, the root mean square error is calculated.
\item\emph{gauss_up}: Same as above but for feature values between the
\emph{max}imum position and the \emph{up}per half-max.  }

data(spectral_data)

## Example calculating the areas of the features around 450nm, 
## 700nm, 1200nm and 1500nm.
bd <- transformSpeclib(subset(spectral_data, season == "summer"),
                       method = "sh", out = "bd")

## Define features
features <- define.features(bd)

## Convert speclib to specfeat giving center wavelength of features
featureSelection <- specfeat(features, c(450,700,1200,1500))

## Calculate properties of features
featureProp <- feature_properties(featureSelection)
